plibv4/Convert

The purpose of convert is to serve as a framework to convert one format into
another, say, 2020-12-31 to 31.12.2020 or 12/31/2020.

Other classes which work with input can request implementations of Convert to
do internal conversion, say, a user entering 31.12.2020 which is then converted
to 2020-12-31 for storage in SQL.
I'd advise to use Validate before using Convert, in order to have reasonable
values to begin with.

Note that Convert is supposed to work on strings and return strings (or scalar
 values, depending on your strict settings), not objects or arrays.

Examples:
-ConvertTime, which converts between seconds, HH:MM:SS and decimal values, ie
 10:30 => 10.5.
-ConvertDate, which converts gregorian dates between ISO 8601, German and US.
